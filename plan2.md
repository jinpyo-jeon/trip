# Weather Considerations

**If Friday is cold/wet:**
- Swap Sporting Clays → SafeShoot (indoor, 12 min from house)
- Distillery and Go-Karts are both indoor - no change needed

**If Saturday is cold/wet:**
- Swap Walkway → SafeShoot or extra time at Go-Karts
- Consider adding Wreck Room (rage room) at Poughkeepsie Galleria - same location as Go-Karts
